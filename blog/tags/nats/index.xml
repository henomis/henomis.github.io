      <description>One of my childhood memories is tied to my aunt’s habit of making pizza dough. It was her favorite way to relax. This might seem normal, except that she was a baker by profession. How ironic, isn’t it? The very job that could be a source of stress became her way to unwind. The funny thing is, after becoming a software developer, I found myself in the exact same situation. I love to code, but sometimes I need to do it to relax.</description>

      <description>Last few months I played with FreeBSD and my Rock64 embedded boards [1] [2]. I really enjoyed the experience and I wanted to go to the next level and experiment with FreeBSD jails. I was surprised how easy (and logical) it was to create and manage an isolated environment. I also noticed that the low level commands have been wrapped into a more user friendly interfaces (like bastille) making the whole experience more enjoyable.</description>
