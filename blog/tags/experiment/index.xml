      <description>This is the sequel to the previous post FreeBSD on a ROCK64 Board. Long story short, I had the chance to resurrect 4 single-board computers that were collecting dust in my office. I decided to install FreeBSD on one of them and it was a success. This time I will show you how and why I installed NetBSD on a second ROCK64 board.
Let&amp;rsquo;s add connectivity to the FreeBSD board The process I described in the previous post was fun and I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>This is a story about an embedded board and a BSD system. The title could have been &amp;ldquo;How to resurrect a forgotten board and fall in love with BSD operating systems, again&amp;rdquo;. It all started 6 years ago when I bought 4 Pine Rock64 boards, with a well planned project in my mind. Each board was equipped with a Rockchip RK3328 quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and a Gigabit Ethernet port.</description>
