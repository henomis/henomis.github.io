Finding the right level of concentration and knowing how to manage it throughout the day are activities that require a concrete **strategy**. In the [previous article](/blog/posts/strategie-per-dosare-la-concentrazione/) we saw how there are four different philosophies for optimizing resources and minimizing distractions.

Regardless of the strategy chosen, maintaining **consistency** in applying the method is anything but simple. In Chinese popular culture, it is said that in order for a behavior to become **a habit**, 21 consecutive days without interruption are required. In this article, I show how there are additional factors that contribute to the successful creation of a habit of **concentration**.

## Ritualizing behaviors

Getting up every morning at 7:00 to take a walk and then working from 10:00 to 18:00 is one of the possible habits a **knowledge worker** may have. Willpower and consistency can help us maintain it as a healthy and fruitful daily practice. But how much did the initial effort cost to force the mind to undertake this change?

Setting change by establishing **rituals** will guarantee us lower energy expenditure and easier management of consistency over time.

### The ritual of place and time

The ritual begins by setting the **place** of work. Whether it is an office, a mountain cabin, a library, or a cafÃ©, it must be clear that this place has been chosen to achieve maximum **concentration** on the tasks to be tackled. Only after this awareness is established should we set a *time slot* that will determine the start and end of the **work period**.

### The ritual of how

Here we are. Weâ€™ve chosen where and for how long to work in a focused manner; now we need structured **rules** to define the *how*. Do you think working without an internet connection helps you achieve deep concentration? Turn off your computerâ€™s network devices. For the same reason, if you find it useful, you might also keep a metric of your tasks.

### Supporting rituals

What could be better than starting a work session with a good coffee? Letâ€™s include it in our ritual to support the main **habit**! Many knowledge workers need to have food ready to avoid distractions, while others need a *standing desk* to work standing for a while. Supporting habits are useful if they help remove distractions from normal activities.

### Practice makes perfect

Finding the right combination of rituals to include in your daily flow is not an immediate activity, but requires **experimentation** and many attempts. Drawing further from Eastern tradition, the ritual that opens up to concentration is an exercise very similar to preparatory meditation.

## The Big Gesture

An additional **strategy** could help make our efforts more credible: the big gesture. In fact, it takes a big gestureâ€”something that commits us economically, emotionally, or physicallyâ€”to seal a ritual. Getting up in the morning and sitting at your desk has a very different impact compared to renting a hotel room for â‚¬200 a night and using it as an office. The perception of the importance of the gesture is directly proportional to the **change** made compared to normal habits. A big gesture will help us avoid the instinct to procrastinate that our mind naturally has. Itâ€™s not just about changing the work environment in search of quiet, but about taking an action that makes us psychologically aware of the **commitment** to invest in our work activity.
