            </div><p>Last few months I played with FreeBSD and my Rock64 embedded boards [<a href="https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/freebsd-on-a-rock64-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">1</a>] [<a href="https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/netbsd-on-a-rock64-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">2</a>]. I really enjoyed the experience and I wanted to go to the next level and experiment with FreeBSD jails. I was surprised how easy (and logical) it was to create and manage an isolated environment. I also noticed that the low level commands have been wrapped into a more user friendly interfaces (like <code>bastille</code>) making the whole experience more enjoyable. To have a real example of a microservice running on a jail, I decided to try with <a href="https://nats.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NATS</a>.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>This is the sequel to the previous post <a href="https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/freebsd-on-a-rock64-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FreeBSD on a ROCK64 Board</a>. Long story short, I had the chance to resurrect 4 single-board computers that were collecting dust in my office. I decided to install FreeBSD on one of them and it was a success. This time I will show you how and why I installed NetBSD on a second ROCK64 board.</p>
<h2 id="lets-add-connectivity-to-the-freebsd-board">Let&rsquo;s add connectivity to the FreeBSD board</h2>
<p>The process I described in the previous post was fun and I learned a lot. However, I used a USB-to-serial adapter to connect to the board, and even though it was fine to complete the installation, I wanted to have a more comfortable way to connect to the board.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>This is a story about an embedded board and a BSD system. The title could have been &ldquo;How to resurrect a forgotten board and fall in love with BSD operating systems, again&rdquo;.
It all started 6 years ago when I bought 4 Pine Rock64 boards, with a well planned project in my mind. Each board was equipped with a Rockchip RK3328 quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and a Gigabit Ethernet port.</p>]]></description>
