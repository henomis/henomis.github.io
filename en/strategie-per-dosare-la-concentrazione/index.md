Working in a focused manner is a fundamental value for every **knowledge worker**. In the [previous article](/blog/posts/lambiente-di-lavoro-una-visione-ideale/), I presented how a **work environment** can be designed so that everyone can enter a state of deep human development, maximizing their personal abilities.

However, human beings, by their very nature, are in constant struggle with their **desires**. Itâ€™s no surprise that among the most common ones are: eating, sleeping, and having sex. Following closely are: taking a break from work, checking email and social media, browsing the web, listening to music, watching TV. After all, every day we must come to terms with our **willpower**, that force which, in a world full of distractions, brings us back to the path of focus. Unfortunately, it is available in **limited quantity**, finite. We can, in fact, think of willpower as a water tank that, when used throughout the day, inevitably tends to empty.

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to define a **strategy** to balance **focus** and **willpower** throughout our workday. In this article, I will present four different philosophical approaches.

## The Monastic Philosophy

Some knowledge workers, in order to focus on their work, need to **eliminate** entirely any side activities such as checking email or answering phone calls. In this case, concentration must necessarily be continuous and without interruptions. Such a choice requires, in advance, a well-planned activity with clear goals, often guided by the philosophy: *do one thing, but do it in the best possible way*.

## The Bimodal Philosophy

While in the monastic philosophy side activities are completely eliminated, in the bimodal philosophy they are banned only during certain **periods**. As the name of this particular strategy suggests, the knowledge worker operates in a monastic way during periods of intense work and dedicates the rest of the time to activities that do not require special concentration. The **division** between the two modes of work does not follow a strict pattern and can occur on different scales. For example, on a **weekly** scale, one might dedicate three full days to intense work and the rest to other activities, or on an **annual** basis, reserve an entire season for more demanding tasks. The minimum unit of division tends to be at least one full day.

## The Rhythmic Philosophy

Followers of this philosophy believe that the simplest way to start having sessions of deep work is to turn them into **habits**. The goal is therefore to create a **rhythm**, eliminating the need to spend energy deciding whether and when to dedicate oneself to activities that require concentration. In contrast to the bimodal philosophy, blocks of deep work often last **ninety minutes**. The level of concentration might not be as high, but itâ€™s an excellent compromise, as it aligns more closely with the reality of human nature. Choosing one over the other depends on oneâ€™s willpower to maintain the set **habit**.

## The Journalistic Philosophy

This strategy does not follow any fixed schedule but simply aims to dedicate time to deep work whenever a **free** *slot* becomes available. This approach is called journalistic because of its resemblance to that profession. A journalist, in fact, the moment they learn about a piece of news, must immediately start a focus session to write the article to be published. This can happen completely **randomly** throughout the day. Such an approach must necessarily take into account that the rapid and frequent **context switching** between activities at various levels of focus can quickly deplete the limited reserve of oneâ€™s willpower.

## The Importance of Choice

Choosing a strategy with which to approach your work is essential for a proper **distribution** of focus throughout the day and an optimal use of your willpower. Reducing the **time** spent deciding on the spot when and how to start a deep work session helps preserve the **mental energy** needed precisely for concentration.
