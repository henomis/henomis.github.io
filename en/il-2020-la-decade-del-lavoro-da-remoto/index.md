2019 has just ended, and we are all filled with the hope that the euphoria of the ‚ÄúRoaring Twenties‚Äù will repeat itself in this century as well. There is particular attention in the economic, technological, and scientific fields, but what will happen in the world of work is the subject of numerous discussions and even predictions. Many people are betting that 2020 will be the year that kickstarts the development of **remote work**, also known as **‚Äúsmartworking‚Äù**. After reading several articles and discussions on the topic, I decided to write this short summary post. It is not meant to be an explanation of what smartworking is (for that I refer you to the [dedicated Wikipedia page](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavoro_agile)), but it does require a few premises:

* As with any change, whether technological or social, there will be a **cost** to bear, there will be **advantages**, and there will be **disadvantages**. I believe it is a positive change for the times we live in, so the advantages will far outweigh the disadvantages.

* Smartworking cannot be applied to every job category, but several job categories will **change their nature** in order to allow remote work.

* The smartworking revolution will initially develop in the USA, pioneers of many changes, while in Europe the *boom* will arrive a few years later, but **the change will be inevitable**.

## **How will the worker‚Äôs life change?**

The development of smartworking will be one of the greatest revolutions in the world of work and will lead to an increase in the worker‚Äôs **quality of life**. There will be flexibility in deciding how to organize one‚Äôs work, precisely because some days are more productive than others. There will no longer be a need to ask the boss for permission to go to an appointment, and workers will be able to take their children to and from school while still having free time for a refreshing run.

After all, the rise of megacities filled with office buildings is a typical effect of the last **industrial revolution**. A vision of *industry* and *production* that does not fit well with the new generation of jobs. For many, the office has become the *worst place to work when trying to maintain concentration and focus on tasks*.

## What do industry experts predict?

There is a real possibility that all of this will happen in a relatively short time. Industry experts are certain and even make bold **predictions** that will disrupt everyday life.

From a social perspective, there will be a return to sharing **hobbies and activities**, which will encourage stronger and better relationships, mitigating problems such as **loneliness** and **isolation**. Many people will look to live in suburban towns, far from the stress of cities, repopulating the countryside in search of a better **quality of life**.

On the other hand, remote work will attract the attention of people who, until yesterday, had no interest in it‚Äîsimilar to what is happening now with *blockchain* and *artificial intelligence*. Some, without fully understanding its characteristics, will apply it incorrectly, replicating the worst aspects of office work. Others, from generations that **will not accept change**, will soon realize that companies failing to embrace the transition will be left behind.

Companies will have the opportunity to **attract talent** on a *global* scale and build diverse and inclusive teams. Those that do not will allow their *competitors* to acquire the best on the market. Even *time* will carry a different weight in **performance evaluation**. The best employees will be those who consistently deliver what they promise, and by the same standard, career advancement opportunities will be assessed. Remote workers, however, will need strong **communication skills**, significant ability to understand assigned *tasks*, and skill in producing written reports.

Usually, companies worry that employees won‚Äôt work enough when operating remotely. In reality, the opposite is expected. There will be major problems caused by **overwork**, which will need to be properly managed. The traditional 8-hour workday will disappear and be replaced by clear goals and responsibilities.

The workplace will also become *accessible* to those with disabilities who find it difficult to reach the office, for example due to **architectural barriers** along the way. There will no longer even be **geographical barriers**‚Äîtalent can be acquired anywhere in the world, and access to opportunities will be decentralized. Additionally, **working parents** will develop a stronger connection with their children, as they will be freer to organize family activities.
