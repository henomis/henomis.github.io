We would have to assign someone to <strong>measure</strong> the time spent responding to emails, handling phone calls, or attending meetings. Surely after a few months we would have a very complete picture of how working time is distributed. But if, for example, it turned out that collateral activities took up 20% of total time, could we automatically calculate <strong>productivity</strong>? Is responding to an email productive? Does attending a meeting perhaps decrease the team’s productivity?</p><p>Even if we accept that distraction has a cost and concentration has value, we must admit that we are in a field that is <strong>hard to measure</strong>. No, it’s not the intrinsic fault of distraction and concentration, but of the type of work: since a <strong>knowledge worker</strong> performs more complex tasks, it is naturally more difficult to measure their efficiency.</p><h2 id=the-culture-of-connection>The Culture of Connection</h2><p>A Harvard Business School professor, a researcher in the field, tried to convince a Boston consulting firm to reserve one day a week for its employees to be <strong>completely disconnected</strong>. Needless to say, this proposal was harshly criticized at the top levels of the company. Furthermore, the company in question had such a strong <strong>culture of connection</strong> that it expected every employee to respond immediately to emails and phone calls. You can understand how <strong>destabilizing</strong> it would be, for both executives and staff, to eliminate internal and external communications one day a week. Nonetheless, despite resistance from managers, the experiment was launched, and the <strong>results</strong> were analyzed from the perspective of the end customer: calmer employees, better communication, and greater satisfaction.</p><p>Why, then, do many companies follow the <strong>culture of connection</strong> even while knowing it negatively affects productivity and final results?</p><h2 id=its-easy>It’s Easy!</h2><blockquote><p>In a corporate context without clear feedback on the impact of certain habits on the final outcome, there will be a tendency to carry on with behaviors that seem easier in the moment. <a href=#bibliography rel>[1]</a></p></blockquote><p>If you are used to asking for information and getting an answer <strong>immediately</strong>, as soon as a problem arises, this will make your life seem <strong>easier</strong>. At least in the moment. Otherwise, you would need to plan your work, be more organized, and focus on something else while waiting for the answer.</p><p>Take meetings, for example. Frequently calling meetings for projects leads to an accumulation of <strong>interruptions</strong> that make it impossible to focus on the day’s tasks. So why do we insist? Because it’s <strong>easier</strong>. For many people, these meetings represent a personal form of organization: instead of using resources to manage their own time, they prefer to let meetings set the rhythm of decision-making.</p><p>Also consider the common practice of forwarding emails to one or more colleagues with the added question, “what do you think?” These emails give the sender a pleasant <strong>feeling of productivity</strong>, since they may have emptied their inbox of requests. This feeling, however, is only temporary and completely illusory.</p><h2 id=the-industrial-age>The Industrial Age</h2><p>So, people tend to adopt habits that seem to make life easier but that lead to poor time management in a type of work that is not measurable by nature. Let’s return now to productivity. If you think, for a moment, of <strong>manual work</strong>, it will be very simple to understand how productive a line worker was during the day. Probably you just need to count how many “pieces” came out of the production line. A <strong>knowledge worker</strong>, on the other hand, has no points of reference, no gears to count, and finds themselves in a historical era that has nothing to do with the <strong>industrial age</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>In the absence of clear indicators of what productivity really means, many <strong>knowledge workers</strong> therefore try to get as close as possible to the indicators of manufacturing and do things in a way that is “visible.” <a href=#bibliography rel>[1]</a></p></blockquote><p>That’s why people tend to respond to emails within an hour or repeatedly organize meetings—these are activities that make you feel “busy.” The <strong>serious mistake</strong> lies precisely here: considering being busy as an <strong>indicator of productivity</strong>, from which comes the automatic satisfaction of having done your job well.</p><h2 id=busy--productive>Busy = Productive?</h2><p>In 2013, the CEO of Yahoo decided to ban <strong>remote workers</strong> and force employees back to the office. The reason? After checking server logs, the company found that <strong>remote workers</strong> connected only a few times to the email service. The CEO thus concluded that “if you are not visibly busy, I assume you are not productive.”</p><p>Seen and analyzed objectively, this concept is outdated. <strong>Knowledge workers</strong> do not work on an assembly line; so-called “conceptual work” is much more similar to <strong>goal-oriented work</strong> (or Agile) than to a production line. That is why, more generally, concentration is a precious asset and distractions are a huge black hole that inexorably swallows up available time.</p><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography</h2><p>[1] Newport, C.
