During the Second World War, the German army dominated Europe thanks in part to the cryptographic technology used in communications: the Enigma machine. To be able to decipher its codes, the British relied on a group of mathematicians, physicists, and linguists who worked in a secret location, **Bletchley Park**, in England. Their work was a true scientific revolution, a fundamental turning point for the Alliesâ€™ victory.

Almost 80 years later, Bletchley Park is once again making history in the field of **technological evolution**. In fact, a summit on Artificial Intelligence was held there, attended by about 100 politicians, academics, and representatives of the tech sector, to outline a development path for this new scientific revolution. The summit produced a final document that will go down in history as the **Bletchley Declaration**. In this article, we will explore the key points of the declaration and its impact on the evolution of AI in the tech world.

## A Global Commitment to Artificial Intelligence Safety

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the world we live in, offering unprecedented opportunities in various sectors, from healthcare to education, from food security to climate protection. However, alongside these opportunities, significant risks also emerge. To address these challenges, the **Bletchley Declaration** was recently released, a document that emphasizes the importance of international cooperation to ensure safe, reliable, and responsible AI.

The Bletchley Declaration recognizes that AI is already an **integral part of our daily lives** and that its use is set to increase. As a result, it is essential that AI is developed and implemented safely, with a focus on being human-centered and responsible. This requires a global commitment to ensure that AI is used for the good of all, promoting inclusive economic growth, sustainable development, and the protection of human rights.

However, the Declaration does not ignore the **risks** associated with AI. These include the potential manipulation of content, the generation of misleading information, and security risks that arise with the advancement of AI. In particular, the Declaration highlights the risks associated with frontier AIâ€”those highly capable AI models that could surpass the abilities of current systems.

To address these risks, the Bletchley Declaration underscores the importance of **international cooperation**. The risks of AI are inherently global and require a coordinated approach to be effectively managed. The Declaration commits to fostering cooperation through existing international forums and other relevant initiatives, with the goal of maximizing the benefits of AI while minimizing its associated risks.

Furthermore, the Declaration acknowledges the crucial role of all stakeholders involved in the AI fieldâ€”from nations to companies, from civil society to academia. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring the **safety** of AI and in promoting inclusive and responsible AI.

The Bletchley Declaration represents an important step toward a future where AI can be used safely and responsibly for the good of all. It is a call to action for all stakeholders involved in AI to regulate this revolutionary technology.
