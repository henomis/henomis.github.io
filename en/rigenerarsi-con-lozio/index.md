Possessing the techniques of a discipline allows us to adopt high-level strategies. In my [previous article](/blog/posts/le-quattro-discipline-dellesecuzione/) I introduced four **disciplines** that help us understand *how* to approach focused work sessions. However, each of us, throughout the day, experiences moments when, drained of energy, we feel the need to be carried away by **idleness**.

> *Idleness is the father of all vices.*

This phrase probably doesn‚Äôt sound unfamiliar to you‚Äîit may have been part of your childhood or something you associate with a loved one. But what does idleness have to do with the world of work? You might be surprised to learn that **laziness** is essential for the proper functioning of our body, just like vitamin D.

## Turning off the brain

While it‚Äôs true that there are methods to [balance focused work sessions](/blog/posts/strategie-per-dosare-la-concentrazione/) and secondary activities, we also need to include another type of activity within our workday. In this case, it is our laziness that guides the kind of occupation we dedicate to our **free time**. Once the workday is over, we should disconnect from thoughts related to work. So, it‚Äôs forbidden to check emails after dinner or mentally replay discussions from meetings. Below we‚Äôll look at three main reasons why it‚Äôs necessary to *turn off the brain.*

### Reason #1: It helps with decision-making

According to popular Chinese culture, one should never make **decisions** in moments of extreme happiness or extreme sadness. In general, our subconscious is often cited as the perfect agent for making decisions in a *distracted* state. And it is precisely on this basis that, in 2006, social psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis proposed the **Unconscious Thought Theory**.

This theory suggests that for decisions requiring well-defined rules, the conscious mind must be involved. To perform, for example, a mathematical calculation, our mind must strictly follow the rules of mathematics. On the contrary, for decisions that involve a large amount of information, contradictions, or constraints, the **unconscious** is better suited to handle the matter. Being distracted and *idling* therefore allows our right hemisphere to naturally untangle inherently complex situations.

### Reason #2: It helps recharge energy

You‚Äôve probably experienced this too. When I spend hours in nature‚Äîwhether hiking in the mountains or walking in the park‚ÄîI always come out *rejuvenated*. In 1980, two psychology researchers at the University of Michigan theorized the **Attention Restoration Theory**, seeking to define attention fatigue. Focusing, in fact, requires **directed attention**. To demonstrate the effects of ART, in 2008 a study was conducted on two groups of people: one free to walk around a large city center, and another inside a **forest**. The experiment showed that the group in the forest achieved better results on subsequent cognitive tests. Attention is a finite resource‚Äîwalking through a city **consumes** a significant amount of it, since one must stay alert to the inherent dangers of the urban environment. The same *recharging* effect can be achieved by talking with a friend or listening to music, while the *draining* effect occurs, for example, when we waste time checking emails after dinner.

### Reason #3: It replaces otherwise unusable time

I often compare our attention to a **tank**: activities that require focus drain it, while restorative activities refill it. Our attention tank has a **capacity** that varies depending on many factors, such as genetics, age, or training. Like an athlete, a **knowledge worker** can also train to increase their hours of sustained attention. However, even the best ‚Äúattention athlete‚Äù must admit that by the end of a demanding workday, their tank‚Äîthough large‚Äîis depleted. It is therefore completely **useless** to try to tackle work issues that require further focus. We can conclude that the time we dedicate to recreational activities is, in any case, time that couldn‚Äôt be used otherwise.

### The shutdown ritual

We‚Äôre at work, our attention tank is running low, we see the **reserve** light flashing‚Äîwe must end the work session and turn off our brain. What if we have an unfinished task? Here are two possible solutions:

* **Have a plan.** Take notes on how you intend to resume the task the next day, through an algorithm or a sequence of steps.
* **Capture the moment.** Pause the task at the most opportune time, so that all surrounding conditions are in a balanced state that will be maintained until the next day.

As seen with [**rituals**](/blog/posts/il-rito-della-concentrazione/), the *shutdown ritual* can also be accompanied by an activity that seals its *sacredness* and importance. Reciting a phrase or repositioning objects on your desk will make everything feel more *official* and help your mind internalize it as a **habit**.
