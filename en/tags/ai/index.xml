            </div><p>In the ever-changing world of artificial intelligence, a new AI assistant called <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Claude</a> has arrived on the scene, and it&rsquo;s turning heads. Created by a company called <a href="https://anthropic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Anthropic</a>, Claude is incredibly smart and can understand and communicate with humans in very natural, human-like ways.</p>
<p>What makes Claude so special is the way it has been trained. The folks at Anthropic fed Claude a massive amount of data, which allows it to truly grasp how we humans speak and write. So whether you&rsquo;re chatting with Claude casually or asking it to tackle some complex task, it can handle it all with impressive skill.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Empowering Go: unveiling the synergy of AI and Q&amp;A pipelines</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/empowering-go-unveiling-the-synergy-of-ai-and-qa-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:24:42 +0100</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/empowering-go-unveiling-the-synergy-of-ai-and-qa-pipelines/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>During the Second World War, the German army dominated Europe thanks in part to the cryptographic technology used in communications: the Enigma machine. To be able to decipher its codes, the British relied on a group of mathematicians, physicists, and linguists who worked in a secret location, <strong>Bletchley Park</strong>, in England. Their work was a true scientific revolution, a fundamental turning point for the Alliesâ€™ victory.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
