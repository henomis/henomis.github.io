            </div><p>One of my childhood memories is tied to my aunt’s habit of making pizza dough. It was her favorite way to relax. This might seem normal, except that she was a baker by profession. How ironic, isn’t it? The very job that could be a source of stress became her way to unwind. The funny thing is, after becoming a software developer, I found myself in the exact same situation. I love to code, but sometimes I need to do it to relax. And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened when I started to develop my home server.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Running NATS on a FreeBSD Jail</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/running-nats-on-a-freebsd-jail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 15:26:03 +0100</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/running-nats-on-a-freebsd-jail/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>Last few months I played with FreeBSD and my Rock64 embedded boards [<a href="https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/freebsd-on-a-rock64-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">1</a>] [<a href="https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/netbsd-on-a-rock64-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">2</a>]. I really enjoyed the experience and I wanted to go to the next level and experiment with FreeBSD jails. I was surprised how easy (and logical) it was to create and manage an isolated environment. I also noticed that the low level commands have been wrapped into a more user friendly interfaces (like <code>bastille</code>) making the whole experience more enjoyable. To have a real example of a microservice running on a jail, I decided to try with <a href="https://nats.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NATS</a>.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
