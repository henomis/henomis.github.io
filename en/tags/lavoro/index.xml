<p>I have always dreamed of working remotely. The ability to manage my own time, work from anywhere, and better balance personal and professional life seemed like <strong>a utopia</strong> until a few years ago. To be clear, there were pioneering countries, like the <strong>United States</strong>, where remote work is now an established reality, or the <strong>Scandinavian countries</strong>, where workplace flexibility is a widespread practice. But in <strong>Italy</strong>, until just a few years ago, remote work was considered a true <strong>taboo</strong>. The reasons? Iâ€™ve spent my entire professional life asking myself this <strong>question</strong>, and in the Italian context, the main answer has always been the same: the <strong>cultural factor</strong>.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Cost of Everything</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-costo-del-tutto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 17:20:48 +0100</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-costo-del-tutto/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>Our concentration is a finite resource. I often compare it to a reservoir that provides &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; throughout the workday and that must necessarily be recharged through collateral activities. It goes without saying that it is up to us to choose how to distribute our energy during the day and how to divide it among different tasks. After all, every activity requires a certain amount of <strong>energy</strong> to be completed. So far, so clearâ€”but what happens if we use our concentration trying to carry out several activities at the same time? Staying with the engine metaphor, the effect will be that we cover little ground for each activity we are engaged in, and the result will be unsatisfactory and, in the worst case, frustrating.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Agile work as a habit</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-lavoro-agile-come-abitudine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:32:20 +0200</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-lavoro-agile-come-abitudine/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>Not all jobs can be done remotely. Iâ€™ll start with this <strong>premise</strong>, perhaps obvious to many, because I still find myself debating on social media with people who counter with simplistic arguments, trying to pontificate about which tasks are compatible with <em>remote work</em>. The job market has never been in such a state of <strong>flux</strong> as it is now and, thanks to a major technological push, we can confidently say that Generation Alpha will perform tasks that have not even been imagined yet. On the other hand, repetitive or low value-added jobs are constantly subject to <strong>automation</strong>. So yes, not all jobs are compatible with <em>remote work</em>, but the trend of jobs that can be done remotely is steadily growing.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Agile work kills</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-lavoro-agile-uccide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 19:10:41 +0200</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/il-lavoro-agile-uccide/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>On August 31, 2022, the simplification adopted during the <strong>COVID emergency</strong> for managing employees in remote work will end. Therefore, there will be no further extensions, and every employee who wishes to work in this mode will need a reformulation of their contract. Exactly as it was in the pre-COVID period. While lawmakers have disregarded the requests of many for a new and simpler access to <em>agile</em> work, companies will still have to face the needs of those who, having experienced remote work, prefer it over working on-site.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Recharging with idleness</title><link>https://simonevellei.com/en/rigenerarsi-con-lozio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 21:27:39 +0200</pubDate><author>Simone Vellei</author><guid>https://simonevellei.com/en/rigenerarsi-con-lozio/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
