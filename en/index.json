[{"categories":null,"content":"One of my childhood memories is tied to my aunt’s habit of making pizza dough. It was her favorite way to relax. This might seem normal, except that she was a baker by profession. How ironic, isn’t it? The very job that could be a source of stress became her way to unwind. The funny thing is, after becoming a software developer, I found myself in the exact same situation. I love to code, but sometimes I need to do it to relax. And that’s exactly what happened when I started to develop my home server. This article, however, is not strictly about my home server. It’s more about the architecture I chose to implement it, specifically using NATS as a message broker. I will explain why I made this choice and how it has benefited my project. The home server TLDR; A mini-pc equipped with a N100 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, running Debian. All the services are containerized using Docker, and the entire system is managed with a single docker-compose file. That’s only the first approach, as I have different plans for the future. Currently, the server runs a few services, including AdGuard, Nextcloud, and Traefik. But the most interesting part is the custom services I developed myself using Go and NATS. The first service: a pollens monitoring system Did you know that I have allergies? Yes, I do. And I hate them. Every spring, when the pollen count rises, I suffer from sneezing, itchy eyes, and a runny nose. It’s not fun at all. Luckily, it’s not so severe, but it’s still annoying. Last year, I found a way to handle it avoiding drugs relying on natural remedies, mostly based on blackcurrant. But to do that effectively, I needed to know the pollen levels in my area with some day’s notice. So, I decided to build a pollen monitoring system using data from the ARPAM Marche website, which provides pseudo-real-time pollen data for my region.

I leveraged this API by writing a lightweight Go program that fetches daily pollen data for my area. The program handles its own scheduling internally, ensuring the data is updated automatically each day and stored in a local SQLite database. On top of this, I developed a simple web interface that presents the latest readings and visualizes historical trends with interactive graphs, making it easy to track pollen levels over time. That’s what I called Pollenium.

Pollenium is great, but if the pollen count spikes, I want to receive an immediate alert. However, I didn’t want to implement this feature directly in Pollenium. I preferred to keep it simple and focused on its core functionality. So, I decided to create a separate architecture to handle notifications. This is where NATS comes into play. Why NATS? NATS is a high-performance messaging system that is lightweight and easy to deploy. It supports various messaging patterns, including publish/subscribe, request/reply, and queuing. Here are some reasons why I chose NATS for my home server: Simplicity: NATS has a simple API and is easy to set up. This was crucial for me as I wanted to focus on developing my home server without getting bogged down in complex configurations. Performance: NATS is designed for high throughput and low latency. Language Support: NATS has client libraries for many programming languages, including Go, which I used for my home server. Notification service The easiest way to receive a notification is through a Telegram bot. The new service I implemented listens for messages on specific subjects and sends a message to my Telegram bot chat. The service is highly configurable and you can specify different subjects to listen to, as well as the message format and chat IDs to send the notifications to. I called this service Telenats. Notifications are NATS JetStream messages, so they are persistent and can be replayed if needed. User interfaces The system was working fine, but I wanted to let NATS handle more than just notifications. Then I had a couple of crazy ideas: why not use NATS to listen for keystrokes? why not use NATS to dispatch messages for a text-to-speech service? I bought an USB numeric keypad and an USB speaker as input/output devices for my home server.

Every keystroke is captured and published to a related NATS subject. This way, I can send “commands” to any service listening to that subject. Simple, right? I called this service Typocast. I just passed the /dev/input/eventX device as a parameter to the container, and it works like a charm.

I needed a couple of things: a service that converts text to speech a service that listens for tts messages and plays the audio after conversion For the text-to-speech conversion, I used Piper it has voices in different languages, including Italian. It comes with a simple http server that accepts text and returns an audio file. The second service, which I called Voicecast, listens for tts messages on a specific NATS subject. When it receives a message, it sends the text to the Piper server, gets the audio file, and plays it using the classic ALSA interface. Putting it all together Now that I had all the components, I needed to connect them. Here’s how currently works: Pollenium every day fetches the pollen data and stores it in the database. If the pollen level exceeds a certain threshold, Pollenium publishes a notification message to a specific NATS subject. Telenats listens for notification messages and sends a message to my Telegram bot chat. If I want to hear the current pollen levels, I can press a specific key on my keyboard. Typocast captures the keystroke and publishes a specific message to the related NATS subject. Pollenium listens for that subject/keystroke and when it receives the message, it gets from the database the current pollens with high levels and publishes a formatted message to the tts NATS subject. Voicecast listens for tts messages, sends the text to the Piper server, gets the audio file, and plays it. Conclusion Using NATS as a message broker for my home server has been a great choice. It has allowed me to build a modular architecture that is easy to maintain and extend. I can easily add new services or modify existing ones without affecting the entire system. Plus, it has been a fun and relaxing experience to develop my home server using Go and asynchronous messaging.

FreeBSD jails are a powerful and flexible feature of the FreeBSD operating system that allow you to create isolated, secure environments within a single FreeBSD instance. Introduced in FreeBSD 4.0, jails provide a lightweight alternative to full virtualization, enabling you to run multiple applications or services in separate, confined spaces without the overhead of a full virtual machine. A FreeBSD jail operates as a chroot environment with additional security and resource management features. Each jail has its own filesystem, network interfaces, and process space, ensuring that processes running inside a jail cannot interfere with those in other jails or the host system. This isolation makes jails an excellent choice for securely hosting multiple applications on a single server, testing software in a controlled environment, or managing multi-tenant environments. Jails are highly configurable, allowing you to fine-tune the level of isolation and resource allocation for each jail. You can assign specific IP addresses, limit CPU and memory usage, and control access to system resources. This flexibility, combined with the lightweight nature of jails, makes them a popular choice for both development and production environments.

With Bastille, you can create new jails, start and stop them, and manage their configurations with simple commands. It also supports templates, which can be used to automate the deployment of pre-configured environments. This makes it an excellent tool for both development and production use cases, where consistency and repeatability are important. Bastille also integrates with ZFS, a robust file system that provides advanced features such as snapshots and cloning. This integration allows for efficient storage management and easy rollback of changes, further enhancing the flexibility and reliability of your jail environments.

They contain a base FreeBSD installation along with any additional packages or configurations that you want to include. Templates are a powerful feature of Bastille that can help you streamline your workflow and ensure consistency across your environments. The idea is to be architecture agnostic, so the template can be used in any FreeBSD system. NATS will be compiled from source, so the template will contain the necessary packages to build it. # install required packages PKG git PKG go Then we can create specific user and group for NATS: # create default group CMD pw groupadd \"${NATS_GROUP}\" # create default user CMD pw useradd -n \"${NATS_USER}\" -g \"${NATS_GROUP}\" -s /usr/sbin/nologin -w no We’ll accept group and user names as environment variables, so we can customize them when creating the jail from the template. Now it’s time to clone the NATS repository and compile it: # download and install nats server CMD \"${GO}\" install \"github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2@${NATS_VERSION}\" CMD \"${INSTALL}\" -o \"${NATS_USER}\" -g \"${NATS_GROUP}\" \"${GOPATH}/bin/nats-server\" /usr/local/bin/nats-server We’ll use go install to download and compile the NATS server, and then we’ll install it in the /usr/local/bin directory. We’ll also set the owner and group of the binary to the user and group we created earlier. As soon as we have the NATS server installed, we can create a configuration file and an init script for it: CP usr / CMD chmod a+x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nats The usr directory contains the configuration file and the init script for the NATS server. We’ll copy them to the root directory of the jail and make the init script executable. Finally, we’ll set the NATS server to start automatically when the jail boots: SYSRC nats_enable=YES SYSRC nats_user=\"${NATS_USER}\" SYSRC nats_group=\"${NATS_GROUP}\" SERVICE nats start Don’t worry too much about the template; you’ll find a link to the repository with the complete code at the end of the article.

If you notice any translation errors or unclear passages, please let me know. 🇮🇹 Read the original post in Italian I have always dreamed of working remotely. The ability to manage my own time, work from anywhere, and better balance personal and professional life seemed like a utopia until a few years ago. To be clear, there were pioneering countries, like the United States, where remote work is now an established reality, or the Scandinavian countries, where workplace flexibility is a widespread practice. But in Italy, until just a few years ago, remote work was considered a true taboo. The reasons? I’ve spent my entire professional life asking myself this question, and in the Italian context, the main answer has always been the same: the cultural factor. Indeed, I could have blamed distrust, the need for control, or even the fear of change. But aren’t these perhaps the pillars of the average Italian manager’s culture? Add to this the lack of technological infrastructure and the legacy of a work system based on hours rather than goals, and the picture is complete. In any case, 2020 marked a turning point. The pandemic forced companies and workers to rethink their habits and experiment with new ways of working. Remote work, which until then had been considered an exception, became the norm. And so, overnight, millions of people found themselves working from home, managing video conference meetings, and coordinating projects via chat. When telling my personal story, I like to think of myself as a child of the Italian great resignation, a phenomenon that saw a significant number of workers voluntarily resign from their jobs, often in search of better working conditions, greater flexibility, or a better work-life balance. Leaving one’s comfort zone and embarking on a different path, in a context of uncertainty and change, was a courageous but necessary choice.

The title could have been “How to resurrect a forgotten board and fall in love with BSD operating systems, again”. It all started 6 years ago when I bought 4 Pine Rock64 boards, with a well planned project in my mind. Each board was equipped with a Rockchip RK3328 quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. The project was to build a cluster of 4 boards to experiment with Kubernetes and Docker. I was very excited about the project, but unfortunately, I never had the time to go through it. The only thing I did was to build a rack to hold the 4 boards together, including a small 5-port switch and a power supply. The rack was placed in a corner of my office and forgotten after some preliminary tests.

There are many Linux distributions, Debian, the derived Armbian, and a plethora of Android versions. Hey, am I getting so old? Then my heart calmed down when I saw the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD support. “They are still there”, I thought. However, just to understand if the boards were still working, I decided to flash the latest Armbian image. I downloaded the image, flashed it on the eMMC, and powered on a board. The board booted, and I managed to connect to it using the serial console. Cool! But wait…look at the ps aux output! Sorry guys, I’m old school, I can’t stand systemd.

But, again, that’s another story. I decided to install FreeBSD on the Rock64 boards. I went to the FreeBSD website and discovered that there were pre-built ROCK64 arm images. “Wow, that’s amazing!”, I thought. I downloaded the image, flashed it on the eMMC, and powered on a board.

To be able to decipher its codes, the British relied on a group of mathematicians, physicists, and linguists who worked in a secret location, Bletchley Park, in England. Their work was a true scientific revolution, a fundamental turning point for the Allies’ victory. Almost 80 years later, Bletchley Park is once again making history in the field of technological evolution. In fact, a summit on Artificial Intelligence was held there, attended by about 100 politicians, academics, and representatives of the tech sector, to outline a development path for this new scientific revolution. The summit produced a final document that will go down in history as the Bletchley Declaration.

To address these challenges, the Bletchley Declaration was recently released, a document that emphasizes the importance of international cooperation to ensure safe, reliable, and responsible AI. The Bletchley Declaration recognizes that AI is already an integral part of our daily lives and that its use is set to increase. As a result, it is essential that AI is developed and implemented safely, with a focus on being human-centered and responsible. This requires a global commitment to ensure that AI is used for the good of all, promoting inclusive economic growth, sustainable development, and the protection of human rights. However, the Declaration does not ignore the risks associated with AI. These include the potential manipulation of content, the generation of misleading information, and security risks that arise with the advancement of AI. In particular, the Declaration highlights the risks associated with frontier AI—those highly capable AI models that could surpass the abilities of current systems. To address these risks, the Bletchley Declaration underscores the importance of international cooperation. The risks of AI are inherently global and require a coordinated approach to be effectively managed. The Declaration commits to fostering cooperation through existing international forums and other relevant initiatives, with the goal of maximizing the benefits of AI while minimizing its associated risks. Furthermore, the Declaration acknowledges the crucial role of all stakeholders involved in the AI field—from nations to companies, from civil society to academia. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring the safety of AI and in promoting inclusive and responsible AI.

It goes without saying that it is up to us to choose how to distribute our energy during the day and how to divide it among different tasks. After all, every activity requires a certain amount of energy to be completed. So far, so clear—but what happens if we use our concentration trying to carry out several activities at the same time?

The law shows us that the relationship between the number of resources and execution time is not linear, because there are hidden “costs” due to the management of parallelization itself.

I’ll start with this premise, perhaps obvious to many, because I still find myself debating on social media with people who counter with simplistic arguments, trying to pontificate about which tasks are compatible with remote work. The job market has never been in such a state of flux as it is now and, thanks to a major technological push, we can confidently say that Generation Alpha will perform tasks that have not even been imagined yet. On the other hand, repetitive or low value-added jobs are constantly subject to automation. So yes, not all jobs are compatible with remote work, but the trend of jobs that can be done remotely is steadily growing. With that premise, in the near future every company will inevitably have to structure itself to be full-remote compliant. The remote work experience during the emergency period catapulted companies and employees into the pressing need for IT tools that could enable communication and work from home. However, the urgency with which companies had to respond to these demands prevented them from focusing on other, equally important, aspects of remote work. As I explained in a previous article: remote work kills. The shift—forced or not—to a distributed model, no longer centralized in the office but highly interconnected, inevitably pushes companies to structure themselves properly, and to kill old and outdated practices. Remote work does not kill company culture, but exposes it, revealing its weaknesses. It goes without saying that introducing remote work into a poorly organized environment or in the absence of a true project methodology is highly risky. And that is what happened in the vast majority of cases during the pandemic emergency. So what are the first precautions to take in order to face this transition effectively and smoothly?

More recent studies, however, have shown that it takes 66 days, even intermittently. Whichever theory you prefer, you must keep in mind that creating a habit has a cost. If the phrase “we’ve always done it this way” locks you into a static balance, you should expect additional costs to shift from sliding friction to rolling friction. Breaking old, well-established patterns to embrace new practices requires a very significant initial effort, which will then tend to stabilize once the organizational machine is up and running. With this premise, and setting the goal of approaching remote work, we can outline the list of ingredients for a successful recipe: Study. As with any new “subject,” the starting point is studying the state of the art. One of my previous articles collects 12 points of reflection as a starting base; in any case, the goal is becoming aware of how a full-remote company operates. Plan. Once ideas and questions are collected, you need to start drafting an operational plan, including which business areas will be involved, and what technical or organizational challenges may arise. Organizing the various steps into a timeline with milestones can help track progress. Involve. The operational plan, both in its creation and implementation, must necessarily be shared as widely as possible. This process of openness will allow potential issues to surface early, not during execution. Destroy. If you imagine that the current project approach—assuming a valid one exists—does not work with the new remote work model, you will need the courage to remove any obstacles to change. Rebuild. Starting from the company’s foundations and then working up through the various departments, everything must be rebuilt through agile design that supports remote work. As you can well imagine, the introduction of remote work within a company is a complex process, of which this article highlights only a few critical points. Beyond being broad, it is also a continuous process over time, so it does not end the moment you are ready for implementation. From my personal point of view, there is no such thing as remote work without agile design. Team decentralization requires a different organization, no longer based on hours, but on goals. The ultimate aim remains to improve company productivity and minimize employee stress.

The first reports of the “heinous crimes” committed by remote work come from across the ocean, specifically from the USA, where the suspect goes by the name remote work. After all, the post-pandemic effect of a forced return to the office has had repercussions even in the cradle of change and innovation. It would seem, then, that this time the lever to counter Change is to rely on company culture. The lack of a fixed in-office workforce would destroy the beliefs, norms, and values important to a company. I would call it a destructive approach to remote work. But let’s start from the beginning: what is meant by company culture? Summarizing some modern definitions, we can outline company culture as the union of the following three points: Values. These may include sharing results, efficiency, inclusion, or transparency. They are the small bricks that form the foundation of a company. Mutual trust. Often achieved through mutual support and open, informal communication, with the goal of fruitful collaboration. Work style. These are the rules that ensure everything works in the best possible way, including conflict management, attitude, or product release flows. Having defined company culture, the next questions that come to mind are: Through what means does a company define the values, trust, and work styles synthesized within its culture? How do employees voluntarily choose to adhere to the company culture? Because, make no mistake, these are not automatic steps. Company culture is also not static but evolves over time, adapting to change. It’s a synergistic and shared process of continuous refinement. Therefore, before blaming remote work for killing company culture, one must be sure that the company has actually gone through the virtuous processes of building values, trust, and work style. And if, indeed, a universally recognized company culture exists, one must ensure that it is positive!

His passion for music has led him, over the years, to develop musical instruments endowed with a soul. Gears, electric motors, and wooden structures that compose innovative works of art, perfectly matching the genre being played. After developing Music Box, a peculiar music box powered by punched paper tapes, and Modulin, a synthesizer-violin, Martin devoted himself to the great project of his life: the Marble Machine. Not a single instrument, but a complex mechanical system capable of synchronously playing a xylophone, a drum kit, and a bass. Years of intense work followed for Martin and, in 2016, he published on YouTube a demonstration video of how his new creation worked. At the time I’m writing this, the video has nearly 215 million views! Martin’s goal is to take the Marble Machine on tour with his band Wintergatan, but the machine is not yet ready to perform. There are mechanical problems, marbles bouncing everywhere, and an inherent difficulty in programming the melody. So, in 2017, he decided to start the Marble Machine X project, aiming to fix the issues and give the musical artwork industrial-level precision. Martin began publishing videos regularly, sharing with his community the various phases of the project. Tens of thousands of CAD-designed parts, made by cutting wood, steel, and plastic. By 2020, the construction of the Marble Machine X had become an extremely modular, yet equally complex, project. In the videos, Martin repeatedly tried to break the record for marbles played without jamming the mechanism or dropping any to the ground. And yet, something wasn’t working in the overall project. Much had improved since 2016, but synchronization issues between instruments still remained. In 2021, Martin released a video in which he decided to halt the design of the Marble Machine X. With exquisite honesty, he explained that the project could not continue through incremental approximations or endless redesigns of individual modules. The time had come to stop and reflect on the future. And it is in one of his videos that Martin presented two books that helped him focus on his goals, reducing everything around him to the bare minimum: Deep Work by Cal Newport and Essentialism by Greg McKeown. 2021 was a sabbatical year, after which he announced in 2022 his return with a new project: the Marble Machine 3. The novelty? A reversal of priorities in the design process: not building a machine containing the instruments, but building the instruments with a machine around them. Leaving Martin to his future now, wishing him all the best for his new project, let’s turn to me for a moment. I was deeply struck by Martin’s first video and started following him both for my passion for music and my interest in that intense tangle of gears composing his instruments. The 2021 video arrived at a particular moment in my professional life, so I immediately decided to buy Deep Work. In his book, Cal Newport addresses one of the critical issues for every knowledge employee, or as he himself calls them, knowledge workers: the pursuit of focus. A real manual on how to deal with commitments, distractions, and, in general, time management at work. A reading as pleasant as it was interesting, one that I needed to fix in my mind somehow. That’s why I wrote a series of articles that go through and re-elaborate on the techniques described in the book, in the style of shared notes.

In general, our subconscious is often cited as the perfect agent for making decisions in a distracted state.

This theory suggests that for decisions requiring well-defined rules, the conscious mind must be involved. To perform, for example, a mathematical calculation, our mind must strictly follow the rules of mathematics. On the contrary, for decisions that involve a large amount of information, contradictions, or constraints, the unconscious is better suited to handle the matter.

To demonstrate the effects of ART, in 2008 a study was conducted on two groups of people: one free to walk around a large city center, and another inside a forest. The experiment showed that the group in the forest achieved better results on subsequent cognitive tests. Attention is a finite resource—walking through a city consumes a significant amount of it, since one must stay alert to the inherent dangers of the urban environment.

In the previous article, I presented how a work environment can be designed so that everyone can enter a state of deep human development, maximizing their personal abilities. However, human beings, by their very nature, are in constant struggle with their desires. It’s no surprise that among the most common ones are: eating, sleeping, and having sex. Following closely are: taking a break from work, checking email and social media, browsing the web, listening to music, watching TV. After all, every day we must come to terms with our willpower, that force which, in a world full of distractions, brings us back to the path of focus. Unfortunately, it is available in limited quantity, finite. We can, in fact, think of willpower as a water tank that, when used throughout the day, inevitably tends to empty. That’s why it’s important to define a strategy to balance focus and willpower throughout our workday. In this article, I will present four different philosophical approaches.

The division between the two modes of work does not follow a strict pattern and can occur on different scales.

In 2013, the CEO of Yahoo decided to ban remote workers and force employees back to the office. The reason? After checking server logs, the company found that remote workers connected only a few times to the email service. The CEO thus concluded that “if you are not visibly busy, I assume you are not productive.” Seen and analyzed objectively, this concept is outdated. Knowledge workers do not work on an assembly line; so-called “conceptual work” is much more similar to goal-oriented work (or Agile) than to a production line. That is why, more generally, concentration is a precious asset and distractions are a huge black hole that inexorably swallows up available time.

You could probably give a rough evaluation, but in reality, even after a few days of walking, you wouldn’t be able to give precise details. In project management, the concept expressed above often gets crystallized inside a roadmap. And here’s where time, resources, and the number of “things to do” inevitably end up inside the famous Gantt chart. The result? The product manager is happy because they get the answer to their question “how long will it take?” The project manager is happy because they can estimate costs based on resource usage. The team is happy because they have a vision of the macro-activities spread over time. All good? No, it’s PURE ILLUSION! They’re all simply walking toward a distant goal with an empirical approximation and, at the first difficulty, the Castle of Gantt will have to be rebuilt from scratch because of a single change! The difference with Agile planning is not committing to horizons you can’t yet see. If this statement seems to clash with your beliefs, don’t blame yourself — you simply don’t know Agile planning.

There is particular attention in the economic, technological, and scientific fields, but what will happen in the world of work is the subject of numerous discussions and even predictions. Many people are betting that 2020 will be the year that kickstarts the development of remote work, also known as “smartworking”. After reading several articles and discussions on the topic, I decided to write this short summary post. It is not meant to be an explanation of what smartworking is (for that I refer you to the dedicated Wikipedia page), but it does require a few premises: As with any change, whether technological or social, there will be a cost to bear, there will be advantages, and there will be disadvantages. I believe it is a positive change for the times we live in, so the advantages will far outweigh the disadvantages. Smartworking cannot be applied to every job category, but several job categories will change their nature in order to allow remote work. The smartworking revolution will initially develop in the USA, pioneers of many changes, while in Europe the boom will arrive a few years later, but the change will be inevitable.

The development of smartworking will be one of the greatest revolutions in the world of work and will lead to an increase in the worker’s quality of life. There will be flexibility in deciding how to organize one’s work, precisely because some days are more productive than others. There will no longer be a need to ask the boss for permission to go to an appointment, and workers will be able to take their children to and from school while still having free time for a refreshing run. After all, the rise of megacities filled with office buildings is a typical effect of the last industrial revolution. A vision of industry and production that does not fit well with the new generation of jobs. For many, the office has become the worst place to work when trying to maintain concentration and focus on tasks.

There is a real possibility that all of this will happen in a relatively short time. Industry experts are certain and even make bold predictions that will disrupt everyday life. From a social perspective, there will be a return to sharing hobbies and activities, which will encourage stronger and better relationships, mitigating problems such as loneliness and isolation. Many people will look to live in suburban towns, far from the stress of cities, repopulating the countryside in search of a better quality of life. On the other hand, remote work will attract the attention of people who, until yesterday, had no interest in it—similar to what is happening now with blockchain and artificial intelligence. Some, without fully understanding its characteristics, will apply it incorrectly, replicating the worst aspects of office work. Others, from generations that will not accept change, will soon realize that companies failing to embrace the transition will be left behind. Companies will have the opportunity to attract talent on a global scale and build diverse and inclusive teams. Those that do not will allow their competitors to acquire the best on the market. Even time will carry a different weight in performance evaluation. The best employees will be those who consistently deliver what they promise, and by the same standard, career advancement opportunities will be assessed. Remote workers, however, will need strong communication skills, significant ability to understand assigned tasks, and skill in producing written reports. Usually, companies worry that employees won’t work enough when operating remotely. In reality, the opposite is expected. There will be major problems caused by overwork, which will need to be properly managed. The traditional 8-hour workday will disappear and be replaced by clear goals and responsibilities. The workplace will also become accessible to those with disabilities who find it difficult to reach the office, for example due to architectural barriers along the way. There will no longer even be geographical barriers—talent can be acquired anywhere in the world, and access to opportunities will be decentralized. Additionally, working parents will develop a stronger connection with their children, as they will be freer to organize family activities.
